		title: "Hi, My name is Alexander James Ian J. Fernandez.",
		description:
			"I'm currently studying as a 3rd year college student in Cavite State University Bacoor Campus. I'm a Computer Science student with a focus on web development. I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, and I'm proficient in using frameworks like React and Node.js. I am a very positive person. I always smile even if there is a problem because for me, being positive can make big changes not just by on yourself but to the people around you. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the latest trends in web development.",
