		title: "Hi, My name is Alexander James Ian J. Fernandez.",
		description:
			"I'm currently studying as a 3rd year college student in Cavite State University Bacoor Campus. I'm a Computer Science student with a focus on web development. I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, and I'm proficient in using frameworks like React and Node.js. I am a very positive person. I always smile even if there is a problem because for me, being positive can make big changes not just by on yourself but to the people around you. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the latest trends in web development.",

		description:
			" When I’m not in school, I usually stay at home. Sometimes, if my friends invite me somewhere, I’ll go, but if not, I just stay in. During my free time, I sometimes play online games or watch movies. I don’t have talents like singing or dancing, but occasionally, I write poetry. Back in high school, I was a fan of rap until now. When I have free time, I watch rap battles. I think this is why I enjoy writing rhyming words with deep meaning. I also hope to become one of them someday. This is what I’m like when I’m not in school.",
